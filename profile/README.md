OpenMarch is an open source drill writing software built on web app frameworks. Eventually it will be a cross platform desktop app.

## What can OpenMarch do?

Check the [website](https://www.OpenMarch.com/) for video demos of what OpenMarch can do!

**Can:**

- Render a navigable canvas of a college football field
- Move a marcher around and see their coordinates printed in relation to yard lines and hashes
  - e.g. "3.25 steps inside 30 S1" or "11 steps behind front sideline"
- Navigate through pages on the canvas
- Have all marcher, page, and coordinate data saved locally to a db
- Save files to the local system
  - Changes are saved automatically as the user makes them
- Undo/redo
  - Undo history stack is baked into the file, so progress is never lost
  - Currently history is unlimited, which could lead to massive files.
  - Likely future revisions will let users define how long they want their history to go.
- Move multiple marchers at once
- Animate marchers in between pages
- Export individual coordinate sheets

**Cannot:**

- Load music of any kind
- Mark props or non-marcher objects
- Export the drill into a pdf of the grid
- Create drill based on shape
- Auto-generate boxes

## What is OpenMarch's goal?

To be a free and easy drill writing solution for marching bands, indoor programs, and applicable performing ensembles.
OpenMarch hopes to be enough for 90% of ensembles with reasonable design needs. We want to make drill writing effortless.

OpenMarch is designed with three principles:

- Stay **free**
- Stay **fast**
- Stay **simple**

There may never be a day where OpenMarch has support for a 3D rendered marching band of 900
with live video feed jumbotron props. OpenMarch's current (and really only) focus is on the drill-writing experience.

### Features in the vision for OpenMarch

- Robust support for drawing pre-defined and custom shapes with a quick workflow for putting marchers into them.
  - Integrate open source tools for quick shape detection (e.g. reading a school's logo and translating that to coordinates).
- Two click follow-the-leader drill generation.
- Support for all operating systems (as it's built in web frameworks).
- Have an accompanying lightweight mobile app for sharing drill sheets/details with students.
- Support reading MIDI and musicXML files for quick page staging and generation.
  - Use open source tools for tempo detection.
- Custom fields/floors with the ability to set custom checkpoints for coordinate references.

## What does OpenMarch use?

Main packages

- [**React**](https://react.dev/) - active state response and all things frontend
- [**Electron**](https://www.electronjs.org/) - container that react app runs in for it to be a desktop app.

Supporting packages

- [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/) - bootstrap
- [**Fabric.js**](http://fabricjs.com/) - the football field "canvas" GUI with marcher dots
- [**Zustand**](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) - global state management

## OpenMarch for developers

Currently only one person is working on this. (notice I said "we" a lot above? makes me feel official).
If you would like to help out or learn more, just shoot me an [email](mailto:alex.dumouchelle484@gmail.com)!

This project is still in its infancy with significant and essential features missing (saving and undo lol). The team
that will bring this to life still need to make significant and path-altering decisions about what OpenMarch will be.
Currently, we ("I") work on this project as often as we ("I") can between work and life. We're ("I'm") motivated by a
vision of simple, fast, and free drill designing software for band programs and designers across the country.

### Onboarding

## OpenMarch for users and drill designers

OpenMarch does not have any releases or production demos available.
Users who want to try it now are welcome follow the strps to spin up a production environment, though it is missing key features a designer may need.

Check back to [OpenMarch.com](https://www.OpenMarch.com/) and this repository periodically for updates. We're looking for some development, help so send your developer friends this way!
